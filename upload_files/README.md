CG model of axolemma 

Model of the axolemma (published in "Molecular dynamics study of stiffness and rupture of axonal membranes" Majdolhosseini et al. 2025 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2025.111266. Details on the bilayer composition are provided in the supplementary material. GROMACS (www.gromacs.org) input files:
